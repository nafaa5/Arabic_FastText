# Arabic_FastText


We distribute pre-trained word vectors for the Arabic language, 
trained on wikipedia and web crawler texts as well as on several Arabic corpora using fastText. 
These models were trained using Skip-Gram with positional weights, 
in dimension 300, with a window size of 15. 

This distribution of this Arabic FastText is used in a project to extract events and temporal relationships that is still in progress. 
For the use of the corpus, you can send an email to nafaa.haffar.5@gmail.com
